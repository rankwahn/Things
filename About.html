<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p style="color:white; font-family:'Times New Roman', sans-serif; width: auto;">CSWagers is a website dedicated to the competitive
    Counter Strike player. The site was made from former and current Counter Strike players who were looking for more
    from the game. We understood the cries from the community were going unanswered. So we decided to take action. With
    128-tick servers, actively roaming admins and not only a zero tolerance rule for cheaters but trolls as well we came
    to clean up a great game with a solid competitive community who want a serious game.</p>

    <p style="color:white; font-family:'Times New Roman', sans-serif; width: auto;">Allowing you to set a wagered price before entering a ranked game lets YOU set the stakes. Bringing the consequence
    for winning and losing to a whole other level.. Having money on the line already deters a troll from playing.
    Actively roaming admins also monitor games by being able to enter and leave games to check for fair and non toxic
    play from all players.

    We also introduce for the first time a Competitive Unranked! A leisured format to test new ideas, have a laid back
    atmosphere and just have fun with no consequence.</p>

    <p style="color:white; font-family:'Times New Roman', sans-serif; width: auto;">We are a website dedicated to hear and listen to our community. We are here to change the things that have flustered
    us in the past. The toxic player will be erased, the cheater is gone. You're left with a competitive player with a
    drive to win. NO BS JUST CS.</p>
