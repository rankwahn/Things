    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>We are a group of guys who were sick of the current CS status Quo, what with toxic players, blatant hackers and borderline dumb teammates. The Idea and execution of ESEA drew our interest but ultimately we were unhappy with how it was executed. We were very fond of how effective their anticheat is which is why weve decided to partner with them to ensure the best possible experience</p>
